## June 8, 2025

Visited a farm that uses aeroponics to grow plants.

Met with an aeroponics expert and inquired about the damaged roots.

He said, “If magnesium nitrate had been sprayed on the leaves before the roots turned yellow, 
they would’ve returned to green within a day.” He reassured me that the issue wasn’t serious and not to worry.

Following his advice that lettuce seedlings should be grown separately, 
I began a comparison test using two different materials: sponge and rockwool.

Within a week, the nutrient issue was resolved, and the plants grew rapidly, consuming more water. 
As a result, the water tank ran dry, and 90% of the plants died!

As shown in the photo, they had matured with dark green leaves, but then withered due to dehydration.

Notably, the surviving plants were the ones that had been failing in the beginning. I had set aside these nearly-dead plants and revived them—and they ended up being the most resilient. Nature’s way is truly remarkable.

I tasted the surviving plants. They were firm and pleasantly bitter—likely with medicinal effects. Previously, I discovered the nutrient solution was diluted 500 times too much, so I added natural organic fertilizer. These plants should be healthier than those grown with chemical fertilizers.

Plants grown from seeds also suffered due to the water shortage, but most survived. However, the plants grown separately in trays may or may not recover fully—we’ll know as they grow larger.

A key success is that the plants grew exactly according to the timeline provided by the Farm Cube Ultra company. I also gained valuable cultivation know-how.

Since I now understand all the internal equipment settings, I’m capable of replacing components and updating the software myself.

On the night of the 21st, I left the replacement valve and vegetable container in the bathroom.

I returned this evening, July 22, for harvesting on the 23rd. To my shock, all the water that had been full until yesterday had completely disappeared, and the roots of the remaining live plants had dried up!

Once I refilled the water, the system resumed functioning normally. Not only the water tank, but also all the water inside the machine’s internal pipes had vanished in just two days. It’s hard to understand how that much water could disappear overnight. I’ve requested the company to install CCTV to monitor the situation.

The remaining plants are still large and vibrant for now, but due to the lack of water for a whole day, their roots have dried out and they may wilt by tomorrow.
